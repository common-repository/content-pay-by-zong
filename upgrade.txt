== Upgrading from 0.1.7 to 0.1.8 ==

To upgrade from version 0.1.7 you simply need to copy the contents of the zip archive over the old version of the plugin.
Important !!! If you have the directory "contentpaybyzong" under the WP plugins directory you MUST delete it.

Activate the new version, it will use the same configuration as the previous version however we have added a new setup option called "Secret Key"
You can leave this option blank and the plugin will work as before BUT the will NOT be secure. In order to secure it you should enter
a Secret Key here. 
You will then need to update the handler URL in the Dashboard of the Zong Developer Network (http://developer.zong.com) and
add the Secret Key query string parameter to the end of the handler URL as described in the readme file (?secretKey=MySecretKey)
You can also find the correct URL to use at the bottom of the plugin settings page.

If you would like even more security you can protect your handler with the IP address of our server which you can find in your access logs.
